# Accounting 101 in Payments
    Why is a credit card called a “credit” card?
    Why is a debit card called a “debit” card?
 
An example of a debit card payment is shown in the diagram below.

  Each transaction in the business system is transformed into at least two journal lines in the ledger system. 
  This is called double-entry accounting, where every transaction must have a source account and a target account.

  Each journal line is booked to an account. 
  Each account belongs to one of the three components in the balance sheet:
          💡Asset = Liability + Equity

## Let’s look at the issuing bank’s ledger as an example:
  #### Bob pays $100 to the merchant with a debit card. We have two accounts involved in this transaction:

    Journal line 1 - From the issuing bank’s point of view, Bob’s bank account is a liability (because the bank owes Bob money). Bob’s bank account is deducted $100. 
    This is a debit record.

    Journal line 2 - Bank’s cash is an asset and the bank’s cash is deducted by $100.
    This is a credit record.

  #### The balance sheet equation still balances with the two journal lines recorded in the ledger.
 
## Bob’s card is called a “debit” card because it is a debit record when paying with a debit card. 
    👉 Why is this important? 
    This is how a ledger system is designed, only a real ledger is more complicated. 
    Applying these strict accounting rules makes reconciliation much easier!
