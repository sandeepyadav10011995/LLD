# The Payments Ecosystem

__Steps 0-1__: 
* The cardholder opens an account in the issuing bank and gets the debit/credit card. 
* The merchant registers with __ISO (Independent Sales Organization) or MSP (Member Service Provider)__ 
  or in-store sales. ISO/MSP partners with payment processors to open merchant accounts.

__Steps 2-5__: The __acquiring process__.
* The payment gateway accepts the purchase transaction and collects payment information. 
* It is then sent to a payment processor, which uses customer information to collect payments. 
* The acquiring processor sends the transaction to the card network. 
* It also owns and operates the merchant’s account during settlement, which doesn’t happen in real-time.

__Steps 6-8__: The __issuing process__.
* The issuing processor talks to the card network on the issuing bank’s behalf. 
* It validates and operates the customer’s account.
