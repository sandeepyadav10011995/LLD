    OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
    We can use PostgreSQL for CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations.

    OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
    We can use PostgreSQL for analytical processing. PostgreSQL is based on HTAP (Hybrid transactional/analytical processing) architecture, 
    so it can handle both OLTP and OLAP well.

    FDW (Foreign Data Wrapper)
    A FDW is an extension available in PostgreSQL that allows us to access a table or schema in one database from another.

    PipelineDB is a PostgreSQL extension for high-performance time-series aggregation, designed to power real-time reporting and analytics

    PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects, allowing location 
    queries to be run in SQL.

    with other business data to build new apps and uncover unique insights.
