1) __Account Payable Automation (Invoicing)__-: Plate IQ solves a problem that is very pervasive and at the same time very unknown, unless you 
   have worked in the industry and faced the problem yourself as it takes $12-30 to manually process one single paper invoice. 
   ___The manual process is extremely manual, tedious, and error-prone.___
2) __Payments__ -: (If you’re reading this from India and wondering why this is a big deal - US is nowhere close to India in terms of digital payments, 
   and this is a big deal. People still write cheques in the US :)). In terms of dollar values, we help our customers digitize hundreds of millions of 
   dollars of invoices every month! We help them pay those right through our platform.
3) __Insights__ -: If you asked us, say, about the price range of cherry tomatoes in New York City within a given date range, it’s likely we’ll have a 
   pretty accurate picture there. If you (as a business) asked us which of your locations (retail outlets) was paying the most for those tomatoes, we’ll 
   be able to tell you! --> These are valuable business and market insights, and we have built them into its own product.
4) __PlateIQ Card | Spends Management__ -: Plate IQ helps businesses simplify their employee expenses management with Plate IQ Card. 
   This is by allowing employees to request new physical / virtual cards for different types of requirements, and taking away the pain 
   and overhead of managing receipts or reimbursements. ___Competitor -: ZETA(India) -: Sodexo Card___
