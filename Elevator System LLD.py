Elevator System:
Expectation -:
    A building -> Multiple Elevator
    Passenger -: Min Wait Time
                 Maintenance
                 Min Running Cost


    Approach -: Components
                - Button
                - Door
                - Panel
                - Elevator Car
                - Building

    Patterns -: Observer Design Pattern
                Composite Design Pattern
                State Design Pattern
                Singleton Design Pattern

    Basic Requirements -:
        1. The elevator can go up and down in a real-world fashion.
            1. When elevator is going up or down, it will stop at all the floors that the users requested.
            2. If the elevator received a request of going down while it is going up, the elevator will go to the 
               highest floor in the current requests, and then go down.
            3. Users can send requests at anytime.
        2. Users can send requests to the elevator from both outside and inside the elevator.
    
    Example -: After understanding the requirement, we can start with our design. From the analysis above, we know 
               that elevator needs to sort the requests by some kind of order. Itâ€™s not by timestamp, because if elevator 
               is at floor 1, and customer A wants to go to floor 4, and B wants to go to floor 2, the elevator should not 
               go to floor 4 first just because A sent the request first. Instead, the elevator should stop at floor 2 and 
               let B out, then go to floor 4 to let A out. Thus, we know that the request should be sorted by the distance 
               from the current floor and not by timestamp.
    
    Requirements -:
        1. Multiple elevator cars and floors are in building
        2. Max Floors and max Elevators
        3. Can have states
            - Move Up
            - Move Down
            - Idle
        4. Doors of the elevator can be opened only in Idle State
        5. Floors through which elevator passes
        6. Panel should be outside and shuld have buttons (State)
        7. Panel inside Elevator Car
        8. Capacity of Elevator
        9. Multiple floors
        10. Interconnected
        11. Service
                - Downtime

   

    Actors :
            Primary Actors -: Pasengers
                - Press Elevevator Panel Button
                - Emerncgy Button
            Secondary Actor -: Admin/System
                - Move?Stop Elevator
                - Algorithm -: Dispatcher Algorithm
                - Display outside/inside
                - Open/Close Door

            Algorithm -: Dispatcher Algorithm

The main structure that we use in this design is HEAP. 
TC: It has a time complexity of O(nlogn). 
SC: The space complexity is O(n).
