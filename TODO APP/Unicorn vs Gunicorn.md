#### Unicorn and Gunicorn are both server software used to deploy web applications written in Python. 
##### Here's a brief explanation of the difference between them:

__Unicorn__ is a web server that is designed to serve __Ruby on Rails applications__. While it is technically possible to use Unicorn with Python 
applications, it is not the best choice since it doesn't have native support for Python.

On the other hand, __Gunicorn (short for "Green Unicorn") is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server__. It is specifically 
designed to serve Python web applications and is compatible with a variety of Python web frameworks, such as Django and Flask. Gunicorn 
can handle multiple requests concurrently and can be configured to scale horizontally by running multiple worker processes.

In summary, while Unicorn and Gunicorn both serve the same purpose of deploying web applications, Unicorn is designed for Ruby on Rails 
applications and Gunicorn is designed for Python applications. Therefore, Gunicorn is the preferred choice when deploying Python web 
applications.
