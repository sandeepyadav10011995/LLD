#### ASGI and WSGI are both specifications for how web servers and web applications should communicate with each other in Python. 
##### Here's a simple explanation of the difference between them:

WSGI, which stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, is the older of the two specifications and has been around for a while. It is used for 
running synchronous Python web applications, where each incoming request is handled by a single thread. WSGI is a simple, synchronous 
interface that provides a consistent way for web servers to communicate with Python web applications.

ASGI, on the other hand, stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It is a newer specification that was developed to handle the 
increasing popularity of asynchronous programming in Python. With ASGI, web servers can handle multiple requests concurrently, making it 
possible to handle more traffic with fewer resources. ASGI is designed to support both synchronous and asynchronous web applications.

In short, WSGI is an older, simpler interface that is used for synchronous Python web applications, while ASGI is a newer, more advanced 
interface that is used for both synchronous and asynchronous web applications.

To summarize for a 15-year old: both ASGI and WSGI are ways for web servers and web applications to talk to each other in Python. WSGI is 
simpler and older, and only works for handling one request at a time. ASGI is newer and more advanced, and can handle multiple requests at 
the same time, which makes it more efficient for handling lots of traffic.
