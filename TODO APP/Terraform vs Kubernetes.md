#### Terraform and Kubernetes are both tools used for managing computer infrastructure, but they serve different purposes.

  Terraform is used for managing the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, databases, and networks. It allows you to write code 
  that describes the resources you need to run your applications, and it can automatically create and manage those resources for you. 
  Terraform helps you manage the infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way, and it can be used with a variety of cloud providers, 
  such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

  Kubernetes, on the other hand, is used for managing containerized applications, which are a way of packaging and deploying software in a 
  portable way. Kubernetes allows you to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications across a cluster of servers. It provides a way 
  to automate the deployment and management of applications, and it can help ensure that the applications are highly available and resilient.

To put it simply, Terraform helps you create and manage the underlying infrastructure, while Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage your 
applications on that infrastructure.

  In summary, Terraform and Kubernetes are both important tools for managing computer infrastructure, but they have different purposes. 
  Terraform helps you manage the underlying infrastructure, while Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage containerized applications on that 
  infrastructure.
