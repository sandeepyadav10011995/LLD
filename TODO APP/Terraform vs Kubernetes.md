#### Terraform and Kubernetes are both tools used for managing computer infrastructure, but they serve different purposes.

  __Terraform__ is used for __managing the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, databases, and networks__. It allows you to write code 
  that describes the resources you need to run your applications, and it can automatically create and manage those resources for you. 
  Terraform helps you __manage the infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way__, and it can be used with a variety of cloud providers, 
  such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

  Kubernetes, on the other hand, is used for __managing containerized applications, which are a way of packaging and deploying software in a 
  portable way__. Kubernetes allows you to __deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications across a cluster of servers__. It provides a way 
  to automate the deployment and management of applications, and it can help ensure that the applications are highly available and resilient.

___To put it simply, Terraform helps you create and manage the underlying infrastructure, while Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage your 
applications on that infrastructure.___

  In summary, Terraform and Kubernetes are both important tools for managing computer infrastructure, but they have different purposes. 
  __Terraform helps you manage the underlying infrastructure__, while __Kubernetes helps you deploy and manage containerized applications on that 
  infrastructure.__
