SQL and NoSQL are both ways of storing and organizing information in a database, but they work in different ways.

SQL is like a filing cabinet where you keep all your important documents. Each document has a specific place in the
cabinet, and you can easily find it by looking it up by its name or category. SQL databases are great for organizing
large amounts of data and ensuring that the data is accurate and consistent. They are commonly used in industries like
finance or healthcare where data accuracy is crucial.

NoSQL, on the other hand, is like a big box where you throw everything in. It's less structured than SQL and doesn't
require you to organize the data in a specific way. Instead, it allows you to store and access data in a more flexible
way. NoSQL databases are great for storing large amounts of unstructured data, like social media posts or videos.

So, SQL is like a filing cabinet where everything is organized and structured, and NoSQL is like a big box where
everything is thrown in and accessed more flexibly.
