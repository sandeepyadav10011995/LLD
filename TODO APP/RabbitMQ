In this section, you will learn how the message flow RabbitMQ takes place. The following procedure is given below:

The producer first publishes a message to an exchange with a specified type.
Once the exchange receives the message, it is responsible for routing the message. The exchange routes the messages taking into consideration other parameters such as exchange type, routing key, etc.
Now bindings are created from exchange to the RabbitMQ Queues. Each Queue has a name that helps in distinguishing the two. Then the exchange routes the message into Queues based on the attributes of the message.
Once the messages are enqueued in the Queue, it remains there until they are handled by a consumer.
The consumer then handles the message from the RabbitMQ Queue.
