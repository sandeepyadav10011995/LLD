* Imagine taking the best of many different languages—C++, C#, Erlang, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Scala.
  Smalltalk—throwing them into a blender and turning it on; the resulting cocktail is Kotlin. The strength of Kotlin is in its diversity.

  - Kotlin is semantically similar to Java
  - Delegation is often a better design tool than inheritance to reuse code, without compromising type safety
  - overload operators
  - Kotlin is leading innovation in the area of asynchronous programming with coroutines and continuations.
      => Coroutines are procedures that take turns doing their task and then suspend to give control to the other coroutines in the group, and 
         resume task.
      => Continuation is the stack that controls the flow of the program, that allows it to skip into different parts of your program. 
         You could use it to control the flow including coroutine.
         
         
 * Reasons to Love Kotlin
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Elegant And Asynchronous Programming
  - Funcional Programming
  - Scripting
  
* Kotlin offers lots more compile-time safety when compared to a lot of other statically typed languages. The code you write will fail less and 
  fail fast—during compilation rather than runtime. This is one of the reasons why the Spring team decided to embrace Kotlin
* Kotlin coroutines makes it a lot easier to create high-performance asynchronous code, compared to what’s available in the Java Development Kit.
* You may intermix Kotlin and Java code in your projects
