# Short/long polling, SSE, WebSocket
    An HTTP server cannot automatically initiate a connection to a browser. 
    As a result, the web browser is the initiator. 
    
## What should we do next to get real-time updates from the HTTP server?
    Both the web browser and the HTTP server could be responsible for this task.

* Web browsers do the heavy lifting: short polling or long polling. 
  * With short polling, the browser will retry until it gets the latest data. 
  * With long polling, the HTTP server doesnâ€™t return results until new data has arrived.

* HTTP server and web browser cooperate: WebSocket or SSE (server-sent event). 
  * In both cases, the HTTP server could directly send the latest data to the browser after the connection is established. 
  * The difference is that SSE is uni-directional, so the browser cannot send a new request to the server, while WebSocket 
    is fully-duplex, so the browser can keep sending new requests.
