Ques1. What are models
  • Single and definitive source for information about your data
  • Consists of all the essential fields and behaviours
  • Each model will map to a single specific database table
  • In Django, models serve as the abstraction layer
  • They are a subclass of the django.db.models.Model

Ques2. What are Views?
  • Django first determines which root URLconf module is to be used
  • That particular Python module is loaded
  • Then, Django looks for the variable urlpatterns
  • URL patterns are run by Django, and it stops at the first match of the requested URL
  • Once that is done, the Django then imports and calls the given view
  • In case none of the URLs match the requested URL, Dango invokes an error-handling view
  
  
Ques3. What is Django?
  • Django's stack is loosely coupled
  • Very less code
  • Quick development
  • Follows Don't Repeat Yourself Principle
  • Consistent
  • Behaviours are explicitly specified
  • SQL statements are not executed too many times
  • Can easily drop into raw SQL
  • Flexibility while using URL's
